    <h4>Time: ~15 mins | Servings: yes</h4>
        <p>A true northeastern staple, I present my rendition of the <em>oh-so-delicious</em> bacon, egg, and cheese, or <strong>BEC</strong>. It’s just as tasty before school or work as it is after a long night watching the Giants lose another game. Ladies and gentlemen, keep your hands and feet inside the aisle and try to keep your socks on. Here's what you'll need to get started:</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Egg - Qty. 1</li>
            <li>Bacon strips - Qty. 2</li>
            <li>Boars Head sliced American Cheese - Qty. 1</li>
            <li>Ketchup - Qty. 1-2 tablespoons</li>
            <li>Salt & pepper to taste</li>
            <li>Brioche bun - Qty. 1 (this is more commonly served with a bagel where I’m from, and rolls, potato buns, and the like work fine, too!)</li>
        </ul>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> I typically prepare this with a broken over-medium egg. I like a touch of runniness, but it can get a little messy, especially on the go. If you break the yolk and let it spread a little inside the white, it’s much more manageable. If runny egg yolk isn’t your favorite, scrambled eggs are delicious here, too.</p>
    <h3>Directions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><p><strong>Cook bacon:</strong> Over medium to medium-low heat, cook bacon until crispy and most fat is rendered. If bacon is splattering grease, lower the heat. Set bacon aside when finished and do not discard grease!</p>
            <li><p><strong>Cook egg:</strong> Add egg to hot bacon grease and wait for the egg white to form. Once it has, use any utensil to gently break a side of the yolk, allowing it to spread within the white. Add a few grinds of pepper and cover until the top begins to cook slightly, roughly 2-3 minutes. flip immediately, and add cheese.</p>
            <li><p><strong>Sear bread:</strong> Just as you flip the egg and add cheese in the prior step, add the brioche bun to the same pan, open side down. let cook while the cheese continues to melt.</p>
            <li><p><strong>Assemble & enjoy:</strong> Remove the bun and egg from the pan once cooked to your liking, then assemble as follows:
                <ol>
                    <li>add some ketchup to the bottom of the seared bun</li>
                    <li>place the egg on top</li>    
                    <li>break the bacon into halves and lay them across the top of egg</li>
                    <li>add salt and pepper to taste</li>
                    <li>add ketchup to the top bun and rest atop the mountain of melty goodness</li>
                </ol></p>
        </ol>
