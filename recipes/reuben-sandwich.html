        <p>Katz Deli is a NY staple, and one of the best kosher-style delicatessens in the city. They’re known for their Pastrami and Corned Beef and have been selling it in the city for over 100 years. The origins of this hot sandwich seem to be unclear, and I recently learned that it may very well hail from…Nebraska? Anyway, I’m going to stick with Arnold Reuben. He was the owner of the now-closed Reuben's Restaurant on E. 58th Street and invented it in 1914 when actress Annette Selos, Charlie Chaplin’s girlfriend, stopped in looking for a bite. Here’s what you’ll need to get started:</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Hot Pastrami - Qty: 1 pound</li>
            <li>Sauerkraut - Qty. 1 cup</li>
            <li>Swiss cheese - Qty. 4 slices</li>
            <li>Russian or Thousand Island Dressing - Qty. 1/4 cup</li>
            <li>Sliced Rye bread - Qty. 2 large slices</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><p><strong>Prepare Pastrami:</strong> Preheat over to 350 degrees. On a large piece of aluminum foil, lay out the pastrami required for the meal and cover in 1-2 tablespoons of water. wrap tightly and add more foil if necessary. Heat for ~5-10 minutes or until hot, but not dry. (note: if you’re cooking for less or want to speed things up, laying a wet paper towel over the Pastrami and microwaving for 20-40 seconds works, too, but larger portions may warm unevenly and require longer cook times)</li>
        <li><p><strong>Prepare remaining ingredients:</strong> Prepare remaining ingredients: in a small saucepan, add a few tablespoons of water and sauerkraut. Simmer until it is hot (this is key as it helps melt the cheese) and leave on a low flame until ready to use. Lay out Rye bread and generously spread either Russian or Thousand Island dressing on each, about 2 tablespoons per side. </li>
        <li><p><strong>Assemble & enjoy:</strong> Lay two slices of cheese directly on the dressing side of one slice of rye bread. Strain hot sauerkraut and place a generous portion directly on the cheese, then place two slices of cheese directly on top of the sauerkraut. Top with a generous portion of hot pastrami then top with the second slice of rye bread. repeat with the remaining ingredients for the second sandwich (yes, it’s upside down right now)</li>
        <li><p><strong>Optional step:</strong>  Aside from cutting in half, your Reubens are done. That said, a lot of folks like their bread toasted/grilled to add a crunch factor and a lot of restaurants and delis do this by default. The easiest and tastiest way to do this is by spreading some butter on the outside of each slice of bread and toasting in a skillet, just like you would a grilled cheese—just a few minutes on each side until you get some nice color and crust. You can also use a griddle, or simply throw it in the oven and bake it for a few minutes.</li>
